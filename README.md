# Crezco OpenCart Extension

## Installation

The quickest way to get started is to use the OpenCart Extension Installer: [Extension Installer](http://docs.opencart.com/en-gb/extension/installer/)

You can simply upload a .zip of the version you wish to install - see releases for pre-packaged versions.

## Setting up your Crezco Account

### Access to the API

You will need access to the Crezco API in order to setup the extension. Please see our docs for more info in how to get setup: [API Documentation](https://documentation.crezco.com/)

### Configuring your default bank account

The extension requires use of a default bank account, and will guide you through the process. For more information on how this works, and how you can test in our Sandbox environment, please see: [Merchant Onboarding](https://documentation.crezco.com/docs/partner/ZG9jOjY3MzI2NzI-merchant-onboarding-workflow)
