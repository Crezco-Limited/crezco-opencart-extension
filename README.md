You will need access to the Crezco API in order to setup the extension. Please see our docs for more info in how to get setup: [API Documentation](https://documentation.crezco.com/)

### Configuring your default bank account

The extension requires use of a default bank account, and will guide you through the process of configuring where you want to receive payments.
